<p class="no_indent block_text">T<span class="smallerfont">HE</span> two little Dramas of
A R<span class="smallerfont">OUGH</span> D<span class="smallerfont">IAMOND</span> and
G<span class="smallerfont">OOD FOR</span> N<span class="smallerfont">OTHING</span>, would
not have been published but for the loss to the English Stage of one of its greatest
ornaments,—the original representative of Margery and Nan. Whatever of goodness of heart,
affection, cheerfulness, honesty, and self-sacrifice may be found in those characters, the
truthfulness with which she pourtrayed such qualities may be mainly ascribed to the fact,
that they existed in her own genuine and most genial nature.</p>

<p class="block_text">It was intended by the Author to keep these with other productions
unpublished, and solely for the professional use of the late Mrs. Fitzwilliam; but the
affliction he has suffered in losing one so dear to him having changed this intention, and
prevented him ever again appearing as Cousin Joe or Tom Dibbles, he has been induced to
print the Dramas in the hope that the female characters may be found suited to young and
rising talent, of which the Stage at the present time unfortunately stands so much in
need.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W<span class="smallerfont">ILLIAM</span>. Come in,
come in—I’m delighted to see you. Harry, lead the horse to the stable.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W<span

class="stage">C</span>.<span class="stage">D</span>.</i></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I thought it was a face I knew. I’m very glad
to see you—it’s more than two years since we met! Where do you come from?—where are you
going to?—and how d’ye do?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. My regiment is quartered about a mile off—we
arrived there but yesterday—I knew you had a country house in the neighbourhood, and I had
come in search of you.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Excellent! now I have indeed a companion, for I
shall expect you to pass all your leisure with me. I thought you were abroad, as I had not
heard from you so long.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. I have been stationed in Ireland.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. You’re looking in excellent health, and your
spirits are as buoyant as ever, I’m sure.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. I have nothing to complain of as regards my
health—my spirits I can’t say much for.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. What, any old creditors troublesome, or——</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. No, I’ve nothing to fear from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Some love affair—some tender attachment.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Now you’re right; I may as well be candid and
tell you so.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Jilted, or rejected, or——</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Shortly after you left me at college, I formed
an attachment to a young girl that I idolized with all the enthusiasm of youth.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Aye, aye; we generally begin that way.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. My passion was returned with equal fervor; when
it became necessary that I should select my position in life. My friends suggested the
army, and my inclination led me to adopt their views. Ireland soon became my destination—a
constant correspondence with the object of my passion was my only solace in exile, and for
months I almost daily opened a letter written by her dear hand.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. How delightful! I have often thought how
charming it must be to receive an eloquent letter from a much-loved source—to have the
colloquial grace of a Sévigné mingled with the fervor of a Heloise, or the moral delicacy
of a Chapone. Oh, my dear fellow, I envy you!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Have you never experienced that happiness?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Never;—but proceed with your history, mine
shall follow—you went to Ireland, and there received letters from the lady of your
love.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. A long silence ensued.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. What anxious hours you must have passed.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Till one morning my servant placed a letter on
my table—the object of my passion had married during her silence.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I guessed as much—always something ominous in a
woman’s silence.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Her parents had met with misfortunes—a wealthy
match presented itself—a match with a title.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. A match with a title!—ignition at once, of
course.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. The temptation, added to the prayers of her
friends, were too much for her. She yielded, but assured me she had done so with a broken
heart—implored me to forget her—that her lot in life was cast, that the stern duties of
her future existence should be fulfilled if she died in the struggle, yet confessed that I
still occupied one little<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg
7]</a></span> corner in her heart, and concluded with a beautiful quotation from
Milton.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. A refined mind, an educated divinity, no
doubt—one formed to adorn the rank she had gained.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. She was indeed accomplished.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I thought so. Spoke Italian, no doubt?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Fluently.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And French?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Better than a native.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. What a woman! Understood music?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. An enthusiast in the science.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And mineralogy and archæology?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Perfectly.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And the steam engine?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And the vestiges of creation?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Yes, and chaos, and everything.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. What a woman! I should have adored her. And you
lost this professor in petticoats?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Irrevocably! She concealed the name and title of
her husband, as she did not wish me to write in reply, as any reproach from me would but
add to her wretchedness—and now you know the cause of my dejection.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I pity you from my heart. If you have
<i>lost</i> a treasure, you should see the one that I have <i>found</i>.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. <i>You</i> are married, I hear.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Yes, I also formed an attachment to a young
girl that I idolised. You have known me some years—that is to say, I was leaving college
shortly after you entered, and you know how I have ever prized education—that it has been
my watchword, my constant theme when I had a seat in Parliament. I don’t sit now, but
that’s not <i>my</i> fault; but when I <i>did</i> sit, my constant agitation was
education. “Educate,” said I, “educate! that is the panacea for every social evil!”</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. I’ve read your speeches.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. You should have heard them—will you hear one
now?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Don’t trouble yourself.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Well, after dinner. One day, Sir, in riding
through the country, my horse stumbled, and I was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span> violently. My head encountered the edge of a
stone wall; the wall being the hardest I was the only sufferer. Stunned and bleeding I was
carried into a farm-house. My injuries were so severe that I was compelled to remain there
for some weeks. The farmer’s daughter constantly waited on me, paid me so much attention,
so amused me, so anticipated my every wish—in short, made herself so necessary to my
comforts, that——</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. You——</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Exactly! I used to watch her every action as I
reclined on my sofa. She was rude and odd, but there was a heartiness in her nature and a
comeliness in her person that pleased me, that really fascinated me, till at last I began
rather to love her.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. You love an uneducated country wench?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. It was silly, wasn’t it? but we are not our own
masters in such matters. However, don’t laugh at me yet. I anticipated the pleasure of
rightly directing her mind, of the happiness in possessing a subject on which to practise
my favorite theory—in short, I pictured a whole life of felicity in educating the object
of my affection.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. For which purpose you married her.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I did, to the great disgust of my connexions;
indeed, my uncle, Lord Plato, has never visited me since my union—has never written, or
noticed me in any way.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. But you found happiness in combining the
character of husband and tutor?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I surrounded her with masters—an English
master, a French master, a music master, a dancing master, a singing master, a
philosophical lecturer, and a political economist.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. And what has been her progress?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Her progress has been entirely stationary. I
can do nothing with her—she seems to rejoice in her ignorance—and, though I sometimes
think she has a capacity for learning, my hopes have been so often disappointed that I now
give her up. She’s a female Orson, Sir, though I confess I was once her Valentine.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Oh, she’s merry enough, and good-humoured
enough; but, my dear Sir, with <i>my</i> prejudices, with <i>my</i> ideas of refinement,
with <i>my</i> delicacy as regards conduct in society, conceive my agony in possessing a
wife who is as wild as an unbroken colt, finds a nickname for everybody, and persists in
being called by her Christian name of—of——</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. What?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I’m ashamed to tell you—Margery.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Margery?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I have tried to persuade her to change it to
Matilda, or Magaretta, or Marguerite, but all in vain—she says her mother’s name was
Margery, her grandmother’s name was Margery, that her name is Margery, and Margery she’ll
be to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">ARGERY</span>. (<i>without</i>) Now, come along, Jack! and
you, Tom, mind how you carry my kitten.</p>

<p class="direction_3"><i>Enter </i>M<span class="smallerfont">ARGERY</span><i> from the

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Now, Jack, mind what I say—how many pigs is there
in the last litter? Oh, I know—eight! Well, you may send one to my cousin Joe—I’ll tell
you where he lives by and by—two to my old dad, and one to Betsy Buncle, my old playfellow
in Lancashire—the three black ones I shall want to have in the parlor to play with.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Pigs in the parlor to play with? Lady
Evergreen, do you not perceive a visitor?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Wait a minute—I’ll speak to him presently. Do as
I bid you; and you, Tom, give my kitten her lunch, and turn all the young terriers loose
on the grass plot, because I like to see ’em tumble over one another—and now go.</p>

<p class="direction_2"><i>Exit </i>S<span class="smallerfont">ERVANTS</span><i> at

<p class="no_indent">—Well, Sir, and how d’ye do, Sir? and (<i>to </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">LENHEIM</span>) how are you, and who are you?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. My dear, my dear, <i>do</i> think of your
station! This is an old friend of mine—we were at college together. Captain Blenheim—Lady
Evergreen.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. (<i>dropping a country curtsey</i>) Hope you’re
well,<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span> Sir—fine
weather for the hay, and nothing can look better as yet than the taters.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Hush, hush! don’t talk, my dear.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Then what did you bring him here for?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. I am delighted in being introduced to the wife
of my old friend.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Well, I ain’t sorry to see you, if it comes to
that, if only for a bit of a change, for my Billy here seldom lets anybody come
a-visiting, and when I ask him why he don’t have a few friends now and then to kick up a
bit of a bobbery——</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. My dear!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I will talk! He says I’m too rough to mix up with
his sort, and that he can’t bring ’em here or take me amongst them till I’m polished up;
but I’m afraid I shall take so much polishing that I shall be worn out before I’m as
bright as he wants me to be.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. I trust not, Madam.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. My dear, will you go into your——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Not just yet—if I talk a little more to the
gentleman he’ll get used to me, and won’t notice my grammar. And I’m not going to stand
mumchance and try to talk that horrid gibberish you’ve been wanting to teach me, when I’ve
got a good English tongue of my own. Leave me alone, Billy, or I’ll set Growler at you.
Please don’t mind us, Sir (<i>to </i>B<span class="smallerfont">LENHEIM</span>), man and
wife, you know, when in company often have a few snaps at one another on the sly, and, as
it’s nobody’s business but their own, why, of course you don’t know what we’re snapping
about, do you?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Certainly not, my lady.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Of course! I suppose <i>you</i>’ve been educated,
haven’t you, Sir?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Your husband and I were at college together.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I know what you mean—you were schoolfellows.
Well, I dare say you’re very glad to see one another. I know I should be very glad to see
my cousin Joe—we were schoolfellows, too—used to go to Old Mother Tickle’s, at the first
house in the village, close to the duck pond. Oh, many and many’s the time I’ve pushed him
into it—up<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span> to his
knees! Oh lord! it was so <i>bong-bong</i>—that’s a bit of French—do you understand it,
Sir?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>who has crossed behind to </i>B<span
class="smallerfont">LENHEIM</span>) Don’t you, don’t you pity me?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. I think her charming—it’s natural gaiety of
heart, nothing more.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. No, no, you’re pleased to compliment.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. (<i>comes between them</i>) Hallo! you’re
whispering! where’s your manners, whispering before a lady? Is that your education, my
dear?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I stand corrected.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Corrected? why, I haven’t touched you—though you
deserve to catch toko, that you do.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Well, my dear friend, I shall expect you to
dine with us to-day.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Ah, do! come and take pot luck!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Lady Evergreen, I implore you!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. If he knows my meaning what does it matter?
You’ll come, won’t you? Oh, do! and bring some of the sojers with you—I like sojers! What
are you, a sharpshooter, or a—what d’ye call ’em?</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. In the infantry, your ladyship.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Infant—infantry! Oh! what, young ’uns in
arms?</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. No, no, my dear!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I know, bless you! but I like what I used to see
in the country—the—the yeo-ho—— No, yeo-ho’s sailors—the yeomanry, that’s it! I like them
best—such red jackets with yellow insides, and a thing on their heads like a tin pot with
a large fox’s brush pulled over it. Oh, didn’t they look prime!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Oh good gracious! oh good heavens! (<i>stamps
about in agony</i>)</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh! look at my Billy dancing! I never saw him so
full of fun before.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Well, Lady Evergreen, I shall certainly accept
your kind invitation: I must return to my quarters for a short time, but will rejoin you
in the course of half-an-hour. I am delighted at meeting you again, Sir William, and
believe me equally delighted at my introduction to your excellent lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. That’s hearty! give me your hand—<i>you’re</i>
the kind o’ man <i>I</i> like, after all.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Don’t be longer than half-an-hour.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Not a moment. Adieu, my lady, for the
present.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Good bye! Come again soon, now.</p>

<p class="direction_3">B<span class="smallerfont">LENHEIM</span><i> goes off at the
back—</i>M<span class="smallerfont">ARGERY</span><i> calls after him.</i></p>

<p class="no_indent">—Captain! <i>bon jour!</i> There! that’s French, there’s a bit of
education for him!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Now, my dear, that we are alone, I must tell
you that your behaviour has been abominable.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh! has it? Now if I didn’t think I was quite the
lady!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. What with your directions respecting your
animals, and your reference to your cousin Joe and the old woman your schoolmistress, and
your ridiculous eulogium on the uniform of the yeomanry, I thought I should have taken to
my heels and have run out of the house.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I wish you had—I know I should have got on much
better without <i>you</i> at my elbow. And as for my cousin Joe, he may be a stupid fellow
and all that, but he’s a very good fellow, and if he don’t know how to make a proper bow,
or a long speech like you do—such as when I’ve heard you practising to yourself about
railroads, and borrowing money, and taxes, and the state of the nation, and situation of
the population, and that horrible Education—<i>he</i> can talk so as I can understand him,
and that’s more than I always can when you talk—and anybody else, for the matter o’ that.
And if I did like the sojers I used to see so often, what harm was there in that? I’m sure
the Captain was a fine man, a very fine man, whiskers and all—and I’ve often looked at him
till I’ve felt as if I could eat him.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I know that you mean no harm—I know that your
heart is pure; but you must learn to be conscious of your present station in society. The
diamond, though of value in its rough and original state, must be polished and set before
it can be worn. Now to-day, when I rang for the cook and wished you to commence giving
your own orders for dinner, and had previously practised you in the<span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span> pronunciation of asking
for <i>cabillaud au gratin poulet roti</i>—<i>pomme de terre bute</i>——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Well, I couldn’t recollect it, and so I thought
it best to ask for what I liked better than anything.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And are you aware what you did ask for?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I only asked for a toad in a hole.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And didn’t you perceive the vain endeavour of
the servant to conceal his laughter? didn’t you perceive my face suffused with
blushes?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Well, I speak according to my knowledge, and I
know I always speak the truth and what I want to say, without any beating about the bush;
and that’s much better than being deceitful and making believe to be glad to see people
when you really wish ’em at Jericho, and go grinning and smiling up to ’em, and shaking
hands, when in your heart you’d like to shake ’em inside out—and make use of fine words
and say beautiful things when you don’t mean it. You may call it polish if you like, but I
call it telling lies.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. But the usages of society—the——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I don’t care! I shall follow my own usages, and I
begin this morning by packing off my French master and my music master; and as for the
dancing master, if he dares come here again and make my feet ache as he did yesterday,
I’ll break his little fiddle over his head for him!</p>

at the big house where I used to take fruit from the farm to all the girls, and she took a

and sing together, and then she came to my father’s and stopped a whole month when she had
the measles. Oh dear! oh! I’m going to cry now—I’m so happy.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>to </i>L<span

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. Indeed we are! I cannot express the pleasure,
the delight I experience at once more meeting the playmate of my infancy.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Don’t you remember blind man’s buff, and puss in

hope to succeed.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">LATO</span>. Don’t allude to the matter, I beg. In the

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh, Polly dear! I never thought to see you any
more! Let me look at you all over! Yes, it is the same—the same eyes, the same mouth, the
same nose—all the<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
same! But you don’t laugh as you used—not look so merry. What’s the matter, dear?—don’t
you do as you like? ar’n’t you happy in your mind?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. A sadness oppresses me that I find very
difficult to conquer.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Your husband worries you, I dare say—mine does
sometimes, though he’s very good to me, one way and another. But I don’t like his wanting
me to learn so much about nouns, and pronouns, and history—and then he gives me such dull
books to read, all about astrology, and chronology, and physiology, and conchology, and
etymology, and how many miles the moon’s off—just as if one wanted to know, as long as it
shines. I can’t bear it! Give me Robinson Crusoe and the Seven Champions—that’s what I
like! But with all his learning I can do what <i>he</i> can’t.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. What’s that, my dear?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Get up on a cold morning. Ah! you should only see
<i>him</i> try!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. Your gaiety of heart, my dear Margaret——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Margery, call me Margery—it sounds more
comfortable.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. My dear Margery——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. That’s it!</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. And animal spirits, are proof against all
temperatures.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Lord! how fine you do talk! you’ll be just the
thing for my husband—I wonder whether I shall like yours. He seems a funny old fellow, and
so grand too, and so upright, and his hair all so nicely floured over. What did you love
him for?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. To gratify the wishes of my parents; the
position that my union insured flattered and pleased me, while it removed the troubles of
my family. I am grateful, very grateful, for his lordship’s preference, I
confess—but—there’s——</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Somebody else you like better. Well, never mind,
dear, you’ll love the old one very well by and by.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. Augustus!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. What, do <i>you</i> know one another too? Why,
he’s my husband’s old schoolfellow, and we’ve asked him to come and pick a bit with us
to-day. Now this is what I like—old friends all meeting together again. Oh! won’t we have
a merry evening!</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. I never thought to see you more.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. This meeting will be most embarrassing! I am
here, with my husband, and——</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. You would wish me to retire.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I can understand—that is the one you like better,
is it? Well, never mind, dear, don’t be afraid of your husband meeting him—they won’t
fight, will they? and if they do, what o’ that? People that fight are often the best
friends in the world when it’s all over.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. If you <i>request</i> me to leave the house, I
can only obey.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. No, no, you mustn’t go—take him to your husband
and say right out, “My dear, this is my old sweetheart, and you must not be jealous, and
though I did like him once, what o’ that? I’m your wife now, and he can only be a friend,
and there’s no harm in a friend coming to see me.” Be upright and downright, my dear—it’s
the best way—for where there’s nothing concealed nothing can pop out.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. There are positions that exact great
discretion from us—that absolutely render concealment a necessity, if only to avoid those

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. May I not exchange one word with you?</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. If you will then immediately leave me, defer
your visit here till another day, and not expose me to an embarrassment that will be most
painful. Where’s my lord?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I don’t know, aunt—he’s somewhere about.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. In the house?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I think so—talking over the state of the nation
with my husband.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. I must seek him instantly. (<i>to </i>B<span

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Listen to me but for one moment, and I will do
all that you desire.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Well, I say nothing, but if aunt really wants to
find her husband she’s gone quite the wrong way, and I’m to say nothing about it. Well,
I’m no tell-tale, but I don’t like it. (<i>goes to the flower-stand, <span

<p class="entrance">C<span class="smallerfont">OUSIN</span> J<span
class="smallerfont">OE</span><i> appears at the back.</i></p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. This must be the house—I found the gate open, and
the Nag’s Head told me this was Sir William’s, and he’s the gentleman that married my
cousin, and—— What, Margery! lord bless us!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. What, Joe, is it you? how d’ye do, Joe? Well, I
am glad to see you! (<i>shakes hands heartily with </i>J<span
class="smallerfont">OE</span>) More old friends meeting, but this is the best of all.
Well, and how are you, cousin Joe?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. Oh, I’m very well, thank ye!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. What’s brought you here? come to see me?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. That’s right.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. I’m going up to a place in London. You see,
mother knows somebody there, and as I didn’t care much about farming, and always had a
kind o’ sort o’ notion of being a bit of a gentleman, why, they said I was cut out for
sarvice, and the end of it is, I’m going to London to be page to a fine lady.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Lord, Joe!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. The very thing for a genteel youth like me, they
say. I ain’t to wear these clothes then. No, I’m to be all over buttons, and have a hat
with gold lace, and my hair is to be curled every morning, and I’m to carry letters in to
missus on a silver plate, and walk arter her with the lap-dog in the street, and take care
nobody’s sarcy to her.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Can’t you stop here a day or two before you go to
your place? we would have such fun—for though my<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span> husband has often said that none of my family must come
here, as he wanted me to forget all their ways, yet as you <i>are</i> here, I think I
could coax him to let you stop. Sit down, Joe—here’s a chair. Well, and so—and how’s your
mother?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. Hearty.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. And what’s the news?—tell me all you can think
of. Has Tom Dixon married Lizzey Turvey yet?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. No; they were going to be married only a week
ago, and when they got to the church Tom took fright and ran all the way home again, and
left Lizzey Turvey crying her eyes out at the porch door.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. You don’t say so! Well, I always said Tom was a
fool. Come close, Joe, don’t be shy—and, oh Joe! how comfortable this is, to have somebody
to talk to in one’s own fashion! I do feel so free and easy again! Well, and tell me, Joe,
is Dame Willows living?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. No—died six months ago.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Did she leave all her money to her nephew, Jem
Porter?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. No, bless your life! Oh, there’s such work!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Come quite close—quite close, and tell me.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. You see, Jem made sure of the money, and lived in
such style—bought a horse and shay, and went to races, and played nine-pins—when, lo and
behold! the old lady died and he found it was all left to a smooth-faced fellow that
nobody never heard on, that got somehow or other into the old lady’s good books and she
had it writ down. It was all because Jem one day kicked her favorite dog, that used to fly
at everybody’s legs—now the dog’s gone to live with a baker, and Jem’s in prison for
debt.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. And Harry Bacon, what’s become of him?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. Gone to sea, because Mary Brown took up with a
tailor what opened a shop from London. And you recollect Tom Hammer the blacksmith?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. Well, if he ain’t gone and bought all
Merryweather’s pigs I’m a Dutchman! And Merryweather’s gone to America, and the eldest
daughter’s married Sam Holloway the cutler, and folks say it ain’t a good match, because
he was a widow with three children all ready<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span> and she might have had Master Pollard the schoolmaster,
and he’s gone and turned serious and won’t let the boys play at no games, and so they’re
all going away to a new man that’ll let ’em do just what they like; and Will Twig has been
found out stealing chickens, and he’s in prison; and Johnny Trotter the postman has opened
a grocer’s shop; and they’ve pulled down the old parsonage and are building a new ’un; and
the doctor’s got a large lamp over his door with big blue and red bull’s eyes; and there’s
a new beadle, and all the parish children have got the hooping-cough, and Mrs. Jenkins’
cow’s dead, and—that’s all!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh, Joe! I can shut my eyes and see everything
and everybody you’ve been talking about, oh so plain! and to see you again does seem so
like old times.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. And didn’t we have games? when you used to climb
up the cherry-tree, and call out to me, “Joe, come and help me, or I shall tumble down and
break something!”</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Yes! and Joe, when my father used to take you and
I to market, and we used to sit at the bottom of the cart and eat apples!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. And when sometimes I used to try to give you a
kiss, what knocks on my nose you used to give me!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Ah! didn’t I?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. And when I got savage how I used to kick you wi’
my hob-nail shoes! Oh! how friendly we was—wasn’t we?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. And how we did sing!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. And dance!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. And were so happy!</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. Oh, Margery!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh, Joe!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. It’s my cousin Joe. He was only giving me a kiss

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. No, we couldn’t help it.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>to </i>M<span

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Don’t send him away yet—we haven’t had half a

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. No, we haven’t had half a talk together.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Don’t you go, Joe.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. I don’t mean to!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. Your conduct, Madam, is most unbecoming! you
forget your station—you forget that you are my wife!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I’m sure I don’t, and I’m sure you take good care
that I sha’n’t.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. You take good care that she sha’n’t.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Hold your tongue, Sir! how dare you speak? I
won’t be tethered so tight any longer, I can tell you—and I <i>will</i> be myself again!
I’ve tried to be somebody else, and I can’t, and I’ll go and put on my old country clothes
again—for I’ve no comfort in these—and then I can do as I like—kiss Joe, and you, and even
that old gentleman—though I shouldn’t much like it.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. (<i>after staring at </i>L<span

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>pointing to his hat</i>) Take off your hat,
Sir!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. I don’t want to quarrel, and I won’t quarrel, if
you’ll only be kind to me; but I will be myself again, for since I’ve been married I feel
as if my head, and my arms, and my legs were all put on the wrong way; and when I am
myself again, if you don’t like me I had better go<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I give it up! I can no longer pursue my darling
theory—it’s all labour in vain!</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">LATO</span>. I told you so, my dear Sir William, I told you
so when you described the humble person you were about to honor with your hand—that the
union could not be a happy one.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I admired her simplicity, her frankness—and I
fondly imagined that if I could unite such qualities with education, with refinement, that
I should create, as it were, a woman of perfection.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">LATO</span>. You now perceive the error of your
speculation—the inutility of striving to elevate humanity from its natural position. There
<i>must</i> exist separate grades of society—the patrician, the commoner, and the
plebeian—seek not to amalgamate,—the process may be very well in a railroad, but with
human nature it must ever create incongruities. Where’s Lady P.? Ah, there! could you have
found another woman like that, how different would have been your fate! Well, as we have
discussed the state of the nation, I must seek her—she’s in the house, no doubt fatigued
with her journey. Don’t look so downcast, Sir William, there’s no help for it now—make the
best of a bad bargain, for it’s an excellent observation, that there’s no making a silk
purse—I need say no more.</p>

<p class="direction_2 italics">Exit at back.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I am sorry, very sorry, to see this sad result
of all my labour, and fear that much unhappiness is in store for both of us. How can I
introduce my wife to society? how can I pass my leisure in the company of one so utterly
uninformed, so incapable of conversation? Ah! my uncle is indeed happy! Blessed with a
woman of intellect, whose natural graces harmonise so sweetly with her accomplishments,
whose refinement is so exquisite, <i>his</i> life will pass like a dream of bliss—like a——
Eh? (<i>looking off <span class="stage">R</span>.<span class="stage">H</span>.<span

weeping—what does it mean? He clasps<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span> her hand, and she does not withdraw it—they come this way.
I—I feel in a very awkward situation! I would not for the world let them be aware that I
had seen them together—I had better retire, and not notice them. I will; I feel as if I
had not the moral courage to face them. (<i>he is about to go off at the back—he

myself, and slip away as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>B<span class="smallerfont">LEN</span>. Ah, Sir William! I am afraid I am a little over
my time. I beg your pardon—I was not aware you had strangers.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>confused</i>) My uncle, and—and his wife. I
thought you might be already acquainted.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">LATO</span>. And so we <i>are</i>, now I look again—’tis
Captain Blenheim, the son of an old friend. Allow me to introduce you to Lady Plato, my
dear—you will be charmed to make the lady’s acquaintance.</p>

<p>L<span class="smallerfont">ADY</span> P. (<i>curtseying with gravity</i>) I shall at
all times be delighted at an introduction to any friend of my husband.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>aside</i>) I’m perfectly astonished!</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. (<i>aside</i>) I couldn’t make believe like
that.</p>

<p>P<span class="smallerfont">LATO</span>. (<i>to </i>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span>
W<span class="smallerfont">ILLIAM</span>) You see, my dear nephew! you perceive what
sweetness, what refined obedience. Ah! a thousand pities you did not make such a
selection; but, as we say in the classics—“<i>a fronte præcipitium a tergo lupus,</i>”—I
need say no more.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>aside</i>) Indeed you needn’t! I am
perfectly satisfied with my unfortunate choice. What dissimulation! (<i>aloud</i>)
Margaret, my dear, will you kiss me?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh, won’t I? There!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And there! (<i>embracing her</i>) You don’t
want to kiss cousin Joe now, I hope?</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. I wouldn’t let her if she did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Bless his heart! I think no more of kissing him
than I should my grandmother—but he must not forget himself.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. I forgive him; and, if agreeable, he may remain
and dine with us.</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. There, Joe, you may stay and dine with us if you
will.</p>

<p>J<span class="smallerfont">OE</span>. Well, then, I will; and I’ll be revenged on his
wittels, if I can’t on him—ha, ha!</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. (<i>to </i>M<span
class="smallerfont">ARGERY</span>) And you are happier in your homely attire?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh, much happier! if only because ’twas what I
wore when you first loved me.</p>

<p>S<span class="smallerfont">IR</span> W. And you will be much happier still if I leave
you to follow the dictates of your own heart and feelings, without the direction of
masters or of books?</p>

<p>M<span class="smallerfont">AR</span>. Oh, that I shall! yet I <i>will</i> try my
hardest to be as you would wish me, if you but let me try in my own way; and I am sure, in
time, you will not be ashamed of me. Don’t give me masters, don’t give me books, but when
you want me to learn, teach me <i>yourself</i>—a loving word and gentle patience, and all
from <i>you</i>, will make us both happy, and me I hope sincere. (<i>to Audience</i>) And,
what will be better still, let but the Rough Diamond be firmly set in <i>your</i> golden
opinion, and she will be sufficiently polished to shine as long as you will permit
her.</p>
